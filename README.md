# raylib-grid-template

Simple grid-based game template for making grid-based games in raylib. Has a simple tile picking system with index validation based on input vector. Grid position and size doesn't need to be tied to the window size and origin. Some simple 16-bit assets also included (digits, symbols, tiles for grid)
